Oracle is the enterprise technology partner that positions companies for tomorrow, today; empowering businesses of all sizes on their journey of digital transformation. Oracle Cloud provides leading-edge capabilities in software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and data as a service.

At Oracle we have invested in delivering a plethora of new Cloud Services and we want to show you how simple – yet powerful they are. We specifically wanted to focus on low code, high productivity services that can be used in building enterprise grade solutions. We believe the best way to do this is to showcase a real world business solution comprised of these services. You will build the entire solution during the course of this workshop all in a stress-free fun environment. 

This workshop will focus on the Self Service Integration (SSI) capabilities within Oracle Cloud Platform for Integration Cloud.  Oracle Self-Service Integration (SSI) automates tasks between cloud applications. Improve your productivity and your collaborations by automating manual tasks without reliance on IT. Integrate Oracle apps with other popular cloud applications, or integrate between your other favorite cloud applications.


## About Self Service Integration Cloud Service

Oracle Self-Service Integration Cloud Service (SSI) lets you automate tasks and communicate with many different cloud applications, providing a cohesive workflow. SSI can be used by anyone who wants to be more efficient and productive by easily keeping track of contacts, documents, events, appointments, email lists, and more by coordinating the communications between cloud applications. SSI uses a process called a recipe that works by letting you specify a trigger, which is the part of the recipe that defines when the recipe is initiated, and the action, which is what the recipe does as a result of the trigger. SSI provides a shared catalog of recipes that you can copy. If you don’t find a recipe that meets your needs, then you can create your own recipe.
